The "Fair" part of "Weighted Fair Queueing" as a scheduling discipline for packet scheduling in a router's output ports means that any packet is going to be scheduled eventually, even if its priority is low.
Correct Answer
  True

The ping service is used to trace the route to a host with a given IP address.
  True 
Correct!

Question 5

Packet scheduling in a router's output ports is a consequence of queueing happening in output ports due to too much traffic arriving.
Correct!
  True 
  False 
 
Question 6
10 / 10 pts

Question 9

The head-of-line blocking in a router's input port is a phenomenon that occurs when a packet destined for some congested output port blocks a packet behind it that is detined for different output port.
Correct Answer
  True

  False 
 
Question 10
10 / 10 pts
Broadcast links: the wait time to try again to transmit a packet after a collision has occurred should be shorter, if the network has a large number of nodes.
