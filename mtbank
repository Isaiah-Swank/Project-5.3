Question 1
Single bit parity checks can detect single bit errors, but only in the data bits.
  False 
 
Question 2
The "Fair" part of "Weighted Fair Queueing" as a scheduling discipline for packet scheduling in a router's output ports means that any packet is going to be scheduled eventually, even if its priority is low.
  True 

 
Question 3
At the link layer, to (forward-)correct errors, the cost in terms of overhead information is higher, compared to error detection.
  True 

 
Question 4
The ping service is used to trace the route to a host with a given IP address.
  False 
 
Question 5
Packet scheduling in a router's output ports is a consequence of queueing happening in output ports due to too much traffic arriving.
  True 
 
Question 6
The ping service is used to see if a host with a given IP address is reachable. It is implemented by way of ICMP messages.
  True 
 
Question 7
 It is the link layer that deals with the "physicality" of the Internet.
  True 
 
Question 8
For broadcast links, if a collision has occurred, the only way to deal with the situation is to abort transmission.
  True 
 
Question 9
The head-of-line blocking in a router's input port is a phenomenon that occurs when a packet destined for some congested output port blocks a packet behind it that is detined for different output port.
  True 

 
Question 10
Broadcast links: the wait time to try again to transmit a packet after a collision has occurred should be shorter, if the network has a large number of nodes.
  False 
 
Question 11
In general, public IP addresses relate to certain physical locations.
  True 

 
Question 12
The length of burst errors that can be detected by the cyclic redundency check may slightly exceed the length of its "generator polynomial".
  False 
 
Question 13
In IPv4, if datagrams get fragmented, the Identification field determines the order of the fragments.
  False 
 
Question 14
At the link layer, if an error is detected by the network interface card, that means that an error has actually occurred.
  False 
 
Question 15
ICMP is used for error reporting, e.g. when a host or switch cannot be reached.
  False 
 
Question 16
Link layer protocols provide reliability only in environments, where there are high error rates.
  True 

 
Question 17
With Hot Potato Routing a certain IP prefix is routed to a First-Hop router on a least cost path.
  False 
 
Question 18
The cyclic redundency check as the most powerful error detection technique in the Internet.
  True 
 
Question 19
The Internet is a "network of networks". As a consequence, IPv4 addresses have two parts, i.e. a network address part and a host address part.
  True 
 
Question 20
In IPv4, the IP header contains a "Protocol" field that contains a reference to the protocol that is "below" IP, i.e. some link layer protocol like Ethernet.
  False 
 
Question 21
Parity checks are a simple, but weak way of detecting or even correcting bit errors.
  True 
 
Question 22
The ping service is used to see if a host with a given IP address is reachable. It is implemented by way of UDP messages.
  False 
 
Question 23
Within an AS, only one Intra-AS routing algorithm is run.
  True 
 
Question 24
Per one run of the traceroute utility, potentially many UDP packets may be sent, but only one ICMP message.
  True 

 
Question 25
ASs are addressed using ASNs (autonomous system numbers).
  True 
 
Question 26
In the network layer, because of the long timescale, the Control Plane is implemented in software.
  True 
 
Question 27
Inter-AS routing is routing between networks in the sense of IP-defined networks.
  False 
 
Question 28
The cyclic redundency check can detect bit errors and bursts of bit errors.
  True 
 
Question 29
The most popular scheduling discipline for packet scheduling in a router's output ports is Weighted Fair Queueing.
  True 

 
Question 30
The lookup of IP address prefixes in forwarding tables works according to "rightmost longest matching".
  False
